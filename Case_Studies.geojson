Following an extensive design competition led by CPDA, ultimately OLIN+Studios Architecture was chosen as the lead designer. The proposal was a 3-block linear rain garden, with other filtration strategies. WC Smith was interested in re-generating this site due to its proximity to adjacent, partially-owned multifamily housing.", "Stakeholders": "WC Smith (developer), Anacostia Waterfront Corporation (gov. corp.), OLIN and Studios Architecture (designer), Vika Capitol\nNitsch Engineering, ", "Links": "a" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.0032, 38.8784 ] } },

The design has three basins: two shallow ones collect rainwater and runoff from rooftops, while the deeper basin houses a central sports center that collects water from the wider community during larger storms. In total, it collects up to 1.7 million L, which can be re-pumped to the water system in dryer periods or drained to the nearby canal.", "Stakeholders": "Municipality of Rotterdam Wallaard (Construction Lead)\nDe Urbanisten (Designer) Engineering Bureau (City)\n", "Links": "1: De Urbanisten, 2: Publicspace.org, 3: Resilientshift.org" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 4.4772, 51.9279 ] } },

It now has involved significant public investment (around €3 billion, of which approx. €1.5 billion is revenue from the sale of land) with acquisition of private investment (around €10 billion). In the process, it razed old buildings and specified flood-related rules for new ones, eg. raising ground by 8-9m above SLR.

Herein, the consortium is mandated to protect against a 1-in-400-year storm. It employs three strategies: improve, maintain, and respond to defenses. Metrics rely on maintaining 2M.m³ of shingle along the 9km bay. While some may question the sustainability of shingle replacement, this project is noteworthy in its financing mechanism, as the PFI provides the incentive to innovate, such as testing tire bales and recycled plastic groin components.", "Stakeholders": "Environment Agency, and private consortium (Westminster Dredging, Dean & Dyball, Mackley Construction, and Mouchel)", "Links": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 0.349, 50.8097 ] } },

", "Project_Overview": "This project addresses the city’s aging downtown waterfront seawall (built in 1934) and includes over 3,700 linear feet of sea wall restoration. Herein, the team developed the first-ever marine surface texture design guidelines to aid marine life. Salmon is a vital species in Seattle that requires light, a highly neglected and missing element in the city’s dark canyons. As such, the design uses custom glass pavers cast into a concrete sidewalk structure to provide ample sunlight and boasts horizontal shelves for algae growth.

By pooling flood risk amongst a large area of thousands of properties, the re-insurance scheme effectively spreads the financial cost of flood risk for private insurance companies to reduce premium costs. It also launched a Build Back Better Scheme to encourage actionable improvements for flooding. It is entirely self-funded by raising roughly £135m every year through a standard levy, i.e., fixed premium based on a home’s council tax band, and a standard excess of £250/policy. Some criticize this scheme for not doing enough to encourage high-risk properties to relocate.", "Stakeholders": "N/A.
